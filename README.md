### Hi there 👋

I'm Ramin, a software engineer focusing on distributed systems and real-time data streaming. I specialize in building scalable Kafka stream applications at bakdata, integrating them into robust streaming data pipelines. With expertise in Java, Python, and Kotlin, I actively contribute to open-source projects like Apache Kafka and Testcontainers.

I've had the privilege of presenting at major tech conferences and stream processing workshops. I hold an M.Sc. in IT Systems Engineering from the Hasso Plattner Institute. I'm skilled in a range of DevOps and data engineering technologies. My passion lies in advancing the field of big data systems and distributed computing.

### Hi there 👋

A software engineer specializing in distributed systems and data streaming. Proficient in Java, Python, and Kotlin, I have developed scalable real-time analytics platforms and improved system performance at bakdata. My open-source contributions include projects like [Apache Kafka](https://github.com/apache/kafka) and [Testcontainers](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java). I have presented at major conferences and conducted workshops on stream processing. 
I hold an M.Sc. in IT Systems Engineering from the Hasso Plattner Institute and am skilled in various DevOps and data processing technologies. I am dedicated to advancing big data systems and distributed computing.
